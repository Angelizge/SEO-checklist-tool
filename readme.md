# The SEO Checklist tool

Hi! Nice to see you here! On my GitHub profile!

In this repository you will find the **SEO Checklist Tool**

Why did I create this tool?

This was one of the wrokshops I worked on during the Marketing Analytics Course Bootcamp at WBS Coding School.


This tool was created to provide a guide of the main important aspects of the Search engine optimization.
The SEO check list is divided into On-page SEO, Technical SEO, SEO Basics, Keyword Research and Off-page SEO.
